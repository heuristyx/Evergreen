A modding API for Everhood.

## Installation
Builds are currently not available. If you want to build manually, use [MonoMod's HookGen](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod/blob/master/README-RuntimeDetour.md) on the [publicized](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer) main assembly (`Assembly-CSharp`), and use the MMHook assembly and main assembly as dependencies.
Build and drop the `Evergreen.dll` file in the BepInEx `plugins` folder.
